    "Comment": "When playing, I found two intersting dynamics that emerge from the game mechanics. One I call \"close encounter\", where Theseus barely manages to hide behind a wall to block the minotaur. The other I call \"role reversal\", where I often find thaat Theseus and the minotaur would end up swapping places during a game. I try to combine the two and demostrate them in this level. I also took this opportunity to demostrate that having more distance between Theseus and minotaur isn't always beneficial, as Theseus may end up having a hard time getting to cover.",
